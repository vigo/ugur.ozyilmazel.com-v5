                    <div id="markdown">
                        <p>It’s all started with the mighty Commodore 16 back in 1984&hellip; 
My grand-mother Muazzes Demiralp had bought my first computer which was 
Commodore 16 aka <strong>C16</strong>. It was looking like Commodore 64 
except the box color:</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/2016-07-25-commodore-16-cbm-museum.jpg" alt="Commodore 16 photo"><p> My first love: Commodore 16 - Photo © <a href="http://cbmmuseum.kuto.de/">CBM Museum</a> 
</p></div>

<p>C16 games were very disappointing. I was expecting to play games which I’ve seen
on Commodore 64. Most of the games were made by C16’s ASCII characters. I remember
like yesterday, I had packed my C16 and put in to a cabinet. One day, a friend of
mine from 7th grade, came to our house. I showed him the User Manual of C16. 
(<em>Middle of 1984</em>).</p>

<p>He started to read the book. After few minutes, he discovered that, It was 
possible to change the colors of screen and borders on C16. I unpacked the C16 
and connected to a TV and we tried:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>COLOR 4,1
</code></pre>

<p>Oh my GOD! Border colors turned to BLACK. This was a kind a milestone in my life. 
We tried every possible numbers;</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>COLOR 4,2
COLOR 4,3
COLOR 4,4
:
:
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>There were only <strong>16 colors</strong> and we had no idea about that&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent at least 4 years (<em>maybe 5</em>) with Commodore 16 and learned lots of
stuff. C16 has a basic but easy graphic modes. It was easy to draw circles, plot
some dots etc&hellip; I remember, I had written some basic programs to draw <code>f(x)</code>
function’s graphical output. Started playing with <code>SIN</code> and <code>COS</code></p>

<p>I knew that, there was a monster called Commodore 64 and I had to promote my
self to it! C64 owners were playing great games and I couldn’t. Again, It was
somewhere in 1989 and my beloved grandmother, again, turned my dreams into
reality. (<em>She passed away in 1998 - miss her everyday&hellip;</em>) She bought
Commodore 64 + 1541 Drive + some cartridges.</p>

<p>I remember, I had called the computer shop and asked them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please copy <strong>One-on-One</strong> and <strong>Barbarian</strong> to a disk for me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Computer shops were copying games to customers. There weren’t any Original Games
back in days (<em>Where I live</em>). All my wish was to play games till the morning 
lights!</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/2016-07-25-one-on-one.png" alt="Screenshot from: One on One game"><p> One on One - Commodore 64 
</p></div>

<p><strong>One on One</strong> was the best basketball game ever! Although It’s old technology,
still amusing and awesome if you compare to actual gaming systems.</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/2016-07-25-barbarian.png" alt="Screenshot from: Barbarian game"><p> Barbarian - Commodore 64 
</p></div>

<p>For two-player fun, <strong>Barbarian</strong> was the most entertaining and challenging game
according to It’s age&hellip;While I was playing games, something has attracted my
attention. The thing pops up before the game starts&hellip; Yes.. I’m taking about
the <strong>crack intros</strong> in-front of the games. <strong>Papillons</strong>’ intro was the first
one I’ve seen&hellip;</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/2016-11-27-papillons.png" alt="Screenshot from: Papillons C64 Intro"><p> First seen intro from: <strong>Papillons</strong> 
</p></div>

<p>I’ve somehow managed to change scroller and added my name: <strong>UGUR</strong>. I had no idea,
how to restart scroller from the beginning of the text. Waited for minutes to
see my injection. I remember, I’ve asked my parents to come to my room and
we all waited to see my name on the screen.</p>

<p>That moment was a kind of milestone for me. I was 16 or 17 and captivated by
the sorcerous sounds and images of that 8-bit master: <strong>Commodore 64</strong> till the
end of my life&hellip;</p>

<h2>Demoscene</h2>

<p>It was 1989. I met a person at a computer shop. Shop owner told me that they
were buying games form that guy. Strange right? Back in days, there were no
software rights, originials etc in Istanbul/Turkey. I asked the guy;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you import games here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gave me a C64 floppy disk and asked me, If I could read/write English. And
he mentioned that, I need to take a look at the programs called <strong>Disk Mag</strong>
inside of the disk. He told me that, there was a section called <strong>Contacts</strong> or
<strong>Advertisements</strong>, pick a random person/address and prep a disk, put some
files from the disk and shoot. Well&hellip; I did :)</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/impulse-norway-1989.png" alt="C64 screenshot, view of a directory list"><p> My first incoming warez disk from Impulse/Norway 
</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>Running Man</strong> was broken. Disk was bended on the postal service.
I remember, <a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=6521&amp;d=18&amp;h=0">Running Man</a> 
was just released on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=923">Amiga</a> and I was probably the
first person (<em>I mean in Istanbul/Turkey</em>) who had that game! Only intro worked 
in the beginning. That was it :)</p>

<p>I acknowledged that there is a kind of clan/world going on. There are people there,
groups there&hellip; Crackers there&hellip; That was sounding super tempting. Only kool
people knew about it :)))</p>

<h2>Dede Demo Brothers</h2>

<p>Since 1984, me and my neighborhood friend Emre Yavuzkal were a kind of software
team called <a href="http://dededemobrothers.com/">Dede Demo Brothers</a>. <strong>Dede</strong> was me.
Means <strong>Grandpa</strong> in Turkish. It was like Grandpa and Demo brothers. Emre’s
handle was Demo :))) He was a Sinclair/Spectrum user. I was Commodore 16. Well,
I can not call this a scene group but feels like it.</p>

<h2>The Hacker Boys</h2>

<p>As you feel, super childish group name for <a href="http://thehackerboys.com/">a scene group</a> right? This was our
first ever official scene group. It was 1989, that C64 disk with mags etc. changed
our lives&hellip;We had coders (<em>C64, Amiga</em>), Graphic and Sound Artists. We were like
eight (<em>8</em>) people.</p>

<p>We released mostly ripped intros. Most of us only knew how to rip and change
code. It was a bit hard for us to code something from scratch.</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/the-hacker-boys.png" alt="C64 screenshot: the hacker boys music player"><p> Full Screen tech-tech, $1800 - $1806 player 
</p></div>

<p>Me and couple crew members joined <a href="http://csdb.dk/group/?id=1462">The Joker Crew</a>.
We were really fast on importing games and demos (<em>Mostly on C64</em>). Unlike
The Hacker Boys, all of our intros were 100% our own product :) My nick/handle 
was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurgen_Reil">Ventor</a>.</p>

<h2>Zombie Boys</h2>

<p>It was mid 1990. I joined the number one scene group of Turkey. <a href="http://zombieboys.net/">Zombie Boys</a>
Mostly they were ruling on Amiga. They recruited Comrades/<a href="http://csdb.dk/group/?id=3206">The Danger Cobra</a>
members all out. Powerful team with coder, gfxers, composers, swappers etc&hellip;</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/zombie-boys-heavy-metal.png" alt="Amiga screenshot: Zombie Boys, Heavy Metal Demo"><p> Zombie Boys, Heavy Metal Demo 
</p></div>

<p>Zombie Boys was founded by the legendary <a href="http://tuncdindas.com">Tunç “Turbo” Dindaş</a>.
This was a kind of school to me. Unlimited resource was available. Do you need
some source code? No problem. New everything! Games to disk mags, intros, docs etc.</p>

<p>I switched my nick name to <strong>vigo</strong>. The master evil of 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0136657/">The Ghostbusters II</a>. I met <a href="http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=13267">Ghost</a>.
He taught me lots of lots of thing about assembly coding. I was so lucky. There
were no internet, no google, no stackoverflow but I had Ghost :)</p>

<h2>Bronx</h2>

<p>All of the Zombie Boys members were really into hip-hop, graffiti, dj-ing stuff.
We love breakdancing and almost every element of hip-hop culture. One of our
members <strong>Jay Master Coke</strong>, he was listening Kurtis Blow’s LP and the song was:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQPZT00wmCw">The Bronx</a> We were looking for a new
name. <strong>Z</strong> was a bit bad idea. Need to read all of the greetings until the last
letter comes :) Jay proposed: <strong>BRONX</strong> as a new group name!</p>

<p>Young Turkish guys choosing a group name which is the most controversial
neighborhood of NewYork/US :)) Sounds really funny right now!</p>

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/public/images/posts/bronx-faith-of-black.png" alt="Amiga screenshot: Bronx, Faith of Black"><p> Bronx, Faith of Black 
</p></div>

<p>I was one the founders of <a href="http://bronxwhq.org">Bronx</a>. We did lots of kool
stuff such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demo, Intro, Game (File, Full-Disk)</li>
<li>Graphics, Fonts, Music Disks</li>
<li>Disk Mags, Pack Mags, Chart Mags</li>
<li>BBSes, Tools</li>
<li>Imports</li>
</ul>

<p>We had more than ten (<em>10</em>) different section in the whole planet. Members from
Germany, Denmark, Holland, Norway, Switzerland, United States, Uk, Greece and
more. Here are some more links about team Bronx:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Other Groups</h2>

<p>I was also worked on some other groups like; Coroner, Mystic, Iris, Agnostic Front,
TRSI, Phobia, Devience &amp; Scoopex. Demoscene is a one big and great family. Had
great friends and friendship. I have friends, we knew each other more than 25
years. Sounds crazy :))</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Started programming in 1984 and still doing it :) Married in 2003. I became a
father in 2011. Computer programming is a hobby, life-style and my job to live.
I love Ruby, Python, Bash, AppleScript, Swift and C. Digging others and playing
with: Golang, Lisp, JavaScript. I use macOS. I’ve been dealing with Python/Django
apps in my daily routine. Command-line is my biyatch!</p>
