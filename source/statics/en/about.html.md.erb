It all started with might Commodore 16 in 1984... My grand-mother Muazzes Demiralp
had bought my first computer. C16 was looking like Commodore 64 except the box
color.

C16 games were very disappointing. I was expecting games which I’ve seen on
Commodore 64. Most of the games were made by C16’s ASCII chars. I remember
like yesterday. I packed my C16 and put in to a cabinet. One day, a friend of
mine visited me at home, I showed him the User Manual of C16. (*Middle of 1984*).

He started to read it. After few minutes, he discovered that, It was possible to 
change the colors of screen and borders on C16. Unpacked the C16 and connected
to a TV and we tried:

    COLOR 4,1

Oh my GOD! Borders changed to BLACK. This was a kind a milestone in my life. We
tried every possible numbers;

    COLOR 4,2
    COLOR 4,3
    COLOR 4,4
    :
    :

> There were only **16 colors** and we had no idea about that...

I’ve spent at least 4 years (*maybe 5*) with Commodore 16 and learned lots of
stuff. C16 has basic but easy graphic modes. It was easy to draw circles, plot
some dots etc... I remember, I had written some basic programs to draw `f(x)`
function’s graphical output. Started playing with `SIN` and `COS`

I knew that, there is a monster called Commodore 64 and I need to promote my
self to it! C64 owners were playing great games and I couldn’t. Again, It was
somewhere in 1989 and my beloved grandmother, again, turned my dreams into
reality. (*She passed away in 1998 - miss her everyday...*) She bought
Commodore 64 + 1541 Drive + some cartridges.

I remember, I had called the computer shop and asked them:

> Please copy **One-on-One** and **Barbarian** to a disk for me!

Computer shops were copying games to customers. There weren’t any Original Games
back in days. All my wish was to play games till the morning lights!

**One on One** is the best basketball game ever! Still amusing although latest
gaming machines and technologies. For two-player fun, Barbarian was one of the
oldies.
