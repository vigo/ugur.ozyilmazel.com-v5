It’s all started with the mighty Commodore 16 back in 1984... 
My grand-mother Muazzes Demiralp had bought my first computer which was 
Commodore 16 aka **C16**. It was looking like Commodore 64 
except the box color:

C16 games were very disappointing. I was expecting to play games which I’ve seen
on Commodore 64. Most of the games were made by C16’s ASCII characters. I remember
like yesterday, I had packed my C16 and put in to a cabinet. One day, a friend of
mine from 7th grade, came to our house. I showed him the User Manual of C16. 
(*Middle of 1984*).

He started to read the book. After few minutes, he discovered that, It was 
possible to change the colors of screen and borders on C16. I unpacked the C16 
and connected to a TV and we tried:

    COLOR 4,1

Oh my GOD! Border colors turned to BLACK. This was a kind a milestone in my life. 
We tried every possible numbers;

    COLOR 4,2
    COLOR 4,3
    COLOR 4,4
    :
    :

> There were only **16 colors** and we had no idea about that...

I’ve spent at least 4 years (*maybe 5*) with Commodore 16 and learned lots of
stuff. C16 has a basic but easy graphic modes. It was easy to draw circles, plot
some dots etc... I remember, I had written some basic programs to draw `f(x)`
function’s graphical output. Started playing with `SIN` and `COS`

I knew that, there was a monster called Commodore 64 and I had to promote my
self to it! C64 owners were playing great games and I couldn’t. Again, It was
somewhere in 1989 and my beloved grandmother, again, turned my dreams into
reality. (*She passed away in 1998 - miss her everyday...*) She bought
Commodore 64 + 1541 Drive + some cartridges.

I remember, I had called the computer shop and asked them:

> Please copy **One-on-One** and **Barbarian** to a disk for me!

Computer shops were copying games to customers. There weren’t any Original Games
back in days (*Where I live*). All my wish was to play games till the morning 
lights!

**One on One** was the best basketball game ever! Although It’s old technology,
still amusing and awesome if you compare to actual gaming systems.

For two-player fun, **Barbarian** was the most entertaining and challenging game
according to It’s age...While I was playing games, something has attracted my
attention. The thing pops up before the game starts... Yes.. I’m taking about
the **crack intros** in-front of the games. **Papillons**’ intro was the first
one I’ve seen...
